# WID3001_Functional-and-Logic-Programming-Assignment
Functional Data Processing

```
Objectives
This problem covers various aspects of functional programming in Python, including
higher-order functions, lambda functions, recursion, comprehensions, and immutability. This
group assignment provides a challenging programming task to deepen your understanding and
proficiency in functional programming paradigms.
Assignment Tasks
Introduction to Functional Programming
Provide a brief overview of functional programming paradigms such as pure functions,
higher-order functions, immutability, comprehensions and recursion.
Discuss lambda functions and their role in functional programming.
Explain how functional programming differs from imperative programming and its advantages.
Finally, analyse the efficiency and performance of your solutions.
Deliverables
Each group (of 5 students) must submit their code solutions along with a brief explanation of
their approach and any challenges faced.
Group assignment should include a complete report detailing the problem statement, solution
approach, implementation details (see assignment tasks above) and outcomes.
Programming problem
Create a program to efficiently process a large log file using functional programming techniques
using Python to extract (be creative) relevant information and generate statistics. You must
create a bogus log file (1000 rows) for this program. The following is an example of a log file:
2024-02-29 08:15:23 - INFO - Starting server
2024-02-29 08:16:45 - ERROR - Connection timed out
2024-02-29 08:17:30 - WARNING - Disk space low
2024-02-29 08:18:02 - INFO - User logged in: username123
2024-02-29 08:19:55 - INFO - File uploaded: document.pdf
2024-02-29 08:20:10 - DEBUG - Processing data
2024-02-29 08:21:30 - ERROR - Internal server error: database connection failed
2024-02-29 08:22:15 - INFO - User logged out: username123
In this example, each line represents a log entry and includes the following information:
Timestamp: The date and time when the event occurred.
Log level: Indicates the severity or importance of the event (e.g., INFO, ERROR, WARNING,
DEBUG).
Message: A brief description of the event or action that occurred, providing context for the log
entry.
This format is commonly used in logging systems to record events, errors, and other relevant
information during the operation of software applications or systems.
Assessment Criteria
Correctness, effectiveness, and efficiency of code solutions.
Adherence to functional programming paradigms.
Clarity and readability of code.
Adherence to deadline and submission requirements.
Submission deadline: Friday of Week 12
Total = 30 marks
